# PicoBramble
A lightweight library for running jobs across multiple machines. Originally designed for a cluster of Raspberry Pis.

Built as a learning exercise - you should probably use something like the [JPPF](http://www.jppf.org/) framework for serious projects.

This project is built using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). It depends on the [FST serialization library](https://github.com/RuedigerMoeller/fast-serialization).
