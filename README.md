A lightweight library for running jobs across multiple machines. Originally designed for a cluster of Raspberry Pis.

Built as a learning exercise - you should probably use something like the [JPPF](http://www.jppf.org/) framework for serious projects. This project is _probably not_ secure. I recommend running this on a private, wired network which is not connected to the internet. 

Some documentation is available on [the wiki](https://github.com/Tom-Willemsen/PicoBramble/wiki).
